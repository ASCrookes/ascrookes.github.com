<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>Once upon a time there was a young man who lived in a small state, named for Mary. He grew up with an older sister and two parents who reign from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gambia">The Gambia</a>. This young man's parents moved to Pakistan for work so he was sent to boarding school in Pennsylvania. He now attends Tufts University and is studying in the dark art of computer magic.</p>
